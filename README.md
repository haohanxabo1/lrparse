lrparse is a tiny, fast Python library written in C for extracting substrings between left and right delimiters.

## Features

- `lr()` — fetches the first occurrence between a left and right delimiter.

- `lrr()` — fetches all non-overlapping occurrences between delimiters.

- Returns results as native Python lists of strings for easy integration

## Install

```sh
pip install lrparse
```
